# HackBio Biocoding Internship - Stage Zero 

## üìñ Project Overview  
This repository contains my submission for the **HackBio Biocoding Internship - Stage Zero Task**. The task requires organizing personal details using **any data structure** of choice and performing **basic data retrieval** using Python.  

---

## üìù Task Description  

The goal of this task is to:  
‚úîÔ∏è Store the following personal information in a structured format  
‚úîÔ∏è Print the stored information.  
‚úîÔ∏è Access and retrieve a specific key-value pair.  

The **chosen data structure** for this task is a **Python dictionary**, which provides an efficient way to store and access key-value pairs.

## üõ† Implementation Details  
### **Code Explanation**

### üë®‚Äçüíª What I Did in This Code

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Chose a Data Structure  
I used a dictionary (`choice_datastru`), which allows storing key-value pairs.  
Each piece of information was stored with a unique key (e.g., `"Name"` as a key and `"Arpit Sharma"` as its value).

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Stored the Data  
Created a dictionary named `choice_datastru` containing:
- `"Name"`: My full name
- `"Slack Username"`: My Slack username
- `"Email"`: My email address
- `"Hobby"`: My hobbies
- `"Country"`: My country
- `"Discipline"`: My academic field
- `"Preferred Programming Language"`: My favorite programming language

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Printed the Entire Dictionary  
Used `print(choice_datastru)` to display all stored information in the terminal.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Accessed a Specific Value  
Used `choice_datastru["Name"]` to extract and print my name separately.
```python
"""
## Use any data structure of your choice to organize the following information:
- Your Name
- Your Slack Username
- Your Email
- Your Hobby
- Your Country
- Your Discipline
- Your Preferred Programming Language
"""

# Storing personal information in a Python dictionary
choice_datastru = {
    "Name": "Arpit Sharma",
    "Slack Username": "Arpit",
    "Email": "8920arpit@gmail.com",
    "Hobby": "Gaming and cooking",
    "Country": "India",
    "Discipline": "Bioinformatics",
    "Preferred Programming Language": "Python"
}

# Printing the entire dictionary
print(choice_datastru)

# Accessing and printing a specific value (Name)
Name = choice_datastru["Name"]
print(Name)
